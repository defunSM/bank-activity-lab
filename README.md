## Project Description

This project looks at three different metrics the average, median and standard deviation to provide insights into the movement of stock prices. The average metric helps provide information of where the stock price gravitates towards. The median price is a good metric to check to see if there are low or high values that might skew the average. Finally the standard deviation is how far away from the average does the stock price typically move away from. Using these three metrics provide a more comprehensive view of the movement of a stock price.
